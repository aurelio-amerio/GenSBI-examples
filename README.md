# GenSBI-examples

In order to run the examples, you need to install the GenSBI package. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install "gensbi[cuda12]@git+https://github.com/aurelio-amerio/GenSBI.git"
```

or if you don't have a CUDA compatible device, you can use:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/aurelio-amerio/GenSBI.git"
```

Make sure you also install this package:

```bash
pip install -e .
